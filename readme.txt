1. hello, this is faraj webssite for the end of the year.
2. i built this web based on knowlage from w3school, openforms and ai tech.
3. the website on this stage is based only on html ans css files (didnt use javascript).
4. i tried to make it look the most pro front end webpage. 
5. the class section - i looked over other pro webs and apps and i saw how they make thir class sections and i copyed the startgy.
6. css - i made alocal css file for each page for easy accssics and better looking for the eye (i know that it should be in one css 7. file, but i decided to saprate it).
8. main page - i called it "index.html" because the github platform have a rule to call the main page "index.html" for it to work with there free domain.
9. the "top nav"can be acssised on evrey page.
10. the "down nav" can be seen on home page and contact page.
