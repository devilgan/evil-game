1. Hello, this is faraj first website for the end of the year.
2. I built this web based on knowlage from w3school, openforms and ai tech.
3. The website on this stage is based only on html ans css files (didnt use javascript).
4. I tried to make it look the most "pro" front end webpage. 
5. The class section - i looked over other "pro" webs and apps and i saw how they make ther class sections and i copyed the startgy.
6. Css - i made a local css file for each html file for easy accssics and better looking for the eye (i know that it should be in one css file, but i decided to saprate it).
7. Main page - i called it "index.html" because the github platform have a rule to call the main page "index.html" for it to work with there free domain.
8. The "top nav" can be used on evrey page.
9. The "down nav" can be used on home page and contact page.
10. anime - 2 player mario and Luigi moving.
